# Sniffgalon

Some tools for easily dumping World of Warcraft API data to `json` and `csv`. Going to expand it in the future, but this is what you get for now. 

## Usage

To dump everything (thats what it does by default), just run [Sniffer/Main.py](https://github.com/Ghostopheles/Sniffgalon/blob/master/Sniffer/Main.py) after installing the requirements from [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Ghostopheles/Sniffgalon/blob/master/requirements.txt) (this is a bit of a band-aid and is also a bit jank - will make it more cohesive in the future).
* This will create both a `Logs/` and `Data/` folder.
* To change the region or locale used, change the global variables in [Sniffer/Shared.py](https://github.com/Ghostopheles/Sniffgalon/blob/master/Sniffer/Shared.py).
