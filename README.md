# BlizzardAPISniffer

Some tools for easily dumping World of Warcraft API data to `json` and `csv`. Have some ideas for more stuff I want to build into it, but for now this is what you get.

## Usage

To dump everything (thats what it does by default), just run `Sniffer/Main.py` after installing the requirements from `requirements.txt`.

To change the region or locale used, change the global variables in `Sniffer/Shared.py`.
